# jobs-data-anlyzer
A tool to provide useful insights into jobs data.

## Issue types

1. `Feature`: May require the creation of a branch, especially if issue title is too broad. e.g. `Create visualization site.`
2. Major: An issue that affects many parts of the `project` and needs to be fixed ASAP. Could be a bug / tool issue.
3. Minor: No need to panic.

## Working with issue-based branches

Lets say you want to work on a `feature` issue for example; **`JDA-12`: Build working visualization site**

### 1. Create a branch of our main repo

Create a branch of`jobs-data-analyzer` via a `JIRA` issue panel see image below;

### 2. Go to the repo on `Github`

Go to the `jobs-data-analyzer` repo on `GitHub` and make sure the `branch` you created exists on `Github`;

### 3. Clone the branch 

Choose `HTTPS`, `SSH`, copy the link and clone the `branch`;

Clone the branch: `git clone -b JDA-12 git@github.com:StackBreakthrough/jobs-data-analyzer.git`

`cd` into the folder and work on your branch

# Shortcut 

You could also could've simply created the branch via your command line; 

``` git checkout -b JDA-12 ``` 

and switched to it for the following steps. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Step 1

Add and commit your changes to your branch `JDA-12` in this case.

#### Step 2

Then `checkout` the `main` `branch` and merge it with your `branch`, `JDA-12` in this case;

### Step 3 

You have a number of options;

1. `git push origin main` or `switch` back to your branch (`JDA-12`) and add more stuff, or push what you already have in that branch to its remote; 
3. `git switch JDA-12` 
4. `git push origin JDA-12`

## Your `branch` belongs to you

Just make sure that your changes are `commited` on your branch before switching to the `main` branch for `merging`.
